<b>Homepage</b> consists of a navigation bar with links to home,bestsellers,search books, search by author, book events, book news, contact and documentation pages.
A small description of the site is also given.
The homepage serves as a descriptive page from where the user has options to delve into one of the areas.<br/>
The homepage has the moving ticker "Welcome to the world of book" only on large screens. <br/>
This is to incorporate the fluid responsive layout for all sizes of screens. <br/>
<br />
<br />
 <b>Further Work</b> : The page can be made more visually appealing by making the center div more interactive to the users. <br />
