        <p>
I would like to thank Prof Rasala for making the course so organized and well structured.<br/>
It is my first course where there has been so much freedom and privileges to learn newer things and
implement. I would like to thank my TA Jagruti for the constructive criticism that helped me keep track 
of myself on the course.
Thank you!
