<h3>Limitations</h3>
1. Search usually returns relevant data. But NYTimes API at times doesn't give the description to a particular book<br/>
2. User preferences couldn't be taken into account. A cache to deal with user preferences would ensure more users visiting the site.<br/>
3. Some fields within a particular search are undefined or empty. This bug is more evident with image thumbnails of Google Books API. This is yet to be handled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
 <h3>Future Scope</h3>
 1. The page can be made more visually appealing by applying more css to the table. <br />
 2. Only links to buy the books are provided, not a gateway to buy. It would be preferable if any API provides secure transactions. <br/>
 3. Would love to add poetry fetching content alongside books as I'm highly inspired by poetry. Implemened the rss feed for fetching the poem of the day.<br/>
     Exploring further options for poetry. Would surely include it once it materializes. <br/>
