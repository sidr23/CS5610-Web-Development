<h3>Bugs</h3>
1. NYTimes API call for individual fields where there exists no data for that particular variable returns undefined.<br/>
2. In case of no result for a particular field from the google books api, the output has undefined or null instead of a notification for it. <br/>
2. In certain searches if the image thumbnail isn't present in the google books api, console gives an error: thumbnail of undefined. This bug is yet to be handled.  <br/>
</p>

 <h3>Difficulties faced</h3>
 1. The documentation of the NYTimes API mentions that calls can be made in a particular manner, but the calls fail. 
     The syntax for getting the correct calls was exhausting to find and it kept returning no results and giving errors. 
     Handled it by maintaing a false cache and the format for data as json instead of jsonp mentioned. <br />
 2. Saving the keys secretly was a big issue. 
     But thanks to Prof Rasala's getkey utility, it has been a task that's accomplished fairly easily! <br/>
