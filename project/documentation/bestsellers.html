<b>Bestsellers Functions:</b><br />
<br />
- <b>BestSeller Booklist</b>: A tab is provided on the navigation menu bar which leads to a page which consists of
  30 mostly sought after categories, some of them are Fiction, Non-Fiction, Children's Books etc. <br/>
<br>
- These categories are placed in a dropdown list consisting of categories.
  With each category of the bestseller list details of the book like Title, Author, Publisher, Description and a link to buy the book from Amazon is provided.<br />
<br>
- The table representation is chosen because it is easier too render tables with media queries from a horizontal layout to vertical layout.
Also, the table is responsive to incorporate fluid responsive layout.<br/>
<br>
-  This page has been made using the NYTimes API and the data is in JSON format. <br/>
  There were a lot of bugs in trying to use the NYTimes API, a detailed report of it is provided in the NYTimes API documentation.<br/>
<br>
- Usage is limited to 5,000 requests per day (rate limits are subject to change).<br/>
<br>
-The main reason for using a drop down box is that it can incorporate a lot more options as compared to any other structure.<br/>
