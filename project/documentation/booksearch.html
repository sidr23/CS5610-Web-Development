<b>Search for books</b>: consists of a textbox in which the user enters a book name or isbn for searching about books and the number of results one wishes to see. <br>
<br>
- The options vary from a maximum of 10 results to a maximum of 50 results. <br/>
<br>
- The main reason of keeping such varied limits is that for most of the books the number of results fetched is fewer than 50. 
<br>
- Apart from some books like Bible and other religious books with varied publications, most of them can be easily incorporated in the 50 result limit.<br/>
<br>
- On button click or enter command, that search value is rendered in a table which has title, author, publisher, published date, description, preview and info links. <br/> 
<br>
- This page is completely responsive and it turns into a vertical table for mobile phones and tablets.<br />
<br>
- The search results are returned from Google Books API that fetches data using JSON <br/>
<br>
- If a user enters garbage value or a book name that doesn't exist, then the user is prompted to search again with a more precise name. <br/>

<br>
- There exist scenarios where the user input's a garbage value or a value for which there exist no results.
<br>
- These searches are handled using javascript, with the help of the predefined function data.hasOwnProperty(argument). <br/>

 <b>Further Work</b> : The page can be made more visually appealing by applying more css to the table. <br />
