<b>BookNews</b> consists of a div with news from the world of Books from <a href="http://www.prlog.org/" target="_blank"> Press Release Log's </a> free news xml data.
 For the users it has an RSS Feed to latest information from the world of books via the RSS feed. A small description of the news and its link is given.<br />
<br />
 The code is mainly based on Prof Rasala's AJAX experiment as demonstrated in class with the NASA RSS Feeds and its associated experiments. 
 The other options were to fetch news which was of the form of JSON data. <br />
 The AJAX Code makes use of an array that can incorporate various different xml news feeds of sites that freely provide book news.<br/>
<br />
 Having understood the working of the retrieving XML data from Prof Rasala's lecture, I worked around those concepts.
 Currently, I have only made use of press distribution log's data I found it to be elabarote and extensive.
<br />
 The page can be further developed by making use of more websites that provide good qualtity of Book News. More work on the page's UI and responsiveness too can be performed.<br />
