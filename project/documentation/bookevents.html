<b>Book Events</b> consists of a list of book events in the US, users can enter their state from the dropdown list for knowing about the latest book events. <br>
<br>
- If events exist in that state, then the user is notified with fields like author,book title, start and end dates of the event, local time, location, venue,city rendered in a table.  <br/>
<br>
- The main reason for using the tabular structure is that a lot of data can be showcased to the user.<br/>
<br>
- If no events exist in that particular state, the user is shown a message saying no events occuring in the state. Search for other nearby states.<br/> 
<br>
- This page is completely responsive and it turns into a vertical table for mobile phones and tablets.<br />
<br>
- The search results are returned from Harper Collins API that fetches data using JSON. It has a limit of 4 calls a second and 7000 calls a day. <br/>
<br>
- The shortcoming of the Harper Collins API is that searching for data takes 15seconds.This is a fairly long duration which demands for patience from potential users. <br/>
<br>
- The API requires key authentication that requires the apikey to be stored secretly. This is done using Prof Rasala's getkey utility. <br/>
<br>
- Cases where a user enters a state for which events don't exist, then the user is prompted to search again with a different state name. <br/>

 <b>Further Work</b> : The page can be made more visually appealing by applying more css to the table. <br />
