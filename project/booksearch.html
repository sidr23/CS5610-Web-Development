<b>Search for books</b>: consists of a textbox in which the user enters a book name or isbn for searching about books. <br>
On button click or enter command, that search value is rendered in a table which has title, author, publisher, published date, description, preview and info links. <br/> 
This page is completely responsive and it turns into a vertical table for mobile phones and tablets.<br />
 The search results are returned from Google Books API that fetches data using JSON <br/>
<br />
 <b>Further Work</b> : The page can be made more visually appealing by applying more css to the table. <br />
