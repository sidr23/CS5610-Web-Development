Have a bug that's troubling me while using the NYTimes API
    <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Project_Experiments/P4.ASPX" target="_blank"> NYTimes </a> 
<br/>
In console an error props up as <b> uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token : </b> when a valid input of the form fiction or nonfiction is entered. <br/>
<br />

Hand search for this link seems fine
<a href="http://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v2/lists/paperback-nonfiction.json?&api-key=ff001b53928ac9b79bc0f6745d6acce2:17:71837079" target="_blank"> JSON data </a> <br/>

Any form of help on why the code fails would be appreciated. Syntax seems fine.
Once this bug is fixed then I can proceed with fluid layout for my entire project.
Would be using Youtube API for author search for the time being. Returns author links if Wikipedia Page exists.
