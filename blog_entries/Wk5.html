Fifth Week's Analysis
</p>

<p>
This week tried RSS using XML feed and AngularJS topics 
</p>

<p>
The experiments I tried this week were
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_5/W05E01.html" target="_blank">Fetching data from external site</a><br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_5/W05E02.html" target="_blank">Fetching data from stored xml file</a><br>

The process of fetching data involved getting rss feed from xml data just the way it was taught in Prof's class. Referred the NASA RSS feed experiment that Professor had shown in class.
