Have a bug that's troubling me while using the NYTimes API
    <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Project_Experiments/P4.ASPX" target="_blank"> NYTimes </a> 
<br/>
In console an error props up as <b> uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token : </b> when a valid input of the form fiction or nonfiction is entered. <br/>
<br />

Any form of help on why the code fails would be appreciated. Syntax seems fine.
Once this is done would proceed with fluid layout for my entire project.
Would be using Youtube API for author search for the time being. Returns author links if Wikipedia Page exists.
