Added a new functionality for book events using the Harper Collins API.<br/>

First experimented this feature via an experiment <a href="../experiments/Project_Experiments/P9.aspx" target="_blank">Harper Collins API</a> and then implemented it. <br/>
<br/>
This is a very handy API and provides versatility to the website. Keys secrecy is again handled by making use of Prof Rasala's getkey utility. <br/>
Would soon be including this feature in my documentation. <br/>
all previous bugs and limitations on other pages have been handled successfully. Esp wrt author searches and book searches for garbage values! <br/>
