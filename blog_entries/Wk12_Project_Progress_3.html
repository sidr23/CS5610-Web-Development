<h3>Project Progress</h3>

<p>
Have worked on almost all my functionalities rendering a rough cut of the project. <br/>
Created the author search, booksearch and a page for displaying bestsellers.
<br/>
Have a lot of work to do in terms of making the CSS responsive for these pages, 
working on project and site homepages. Currently fixing some minor bugs related to the jquery,ajax calls.
Working on the documentation of the project as well.
Would take some more time and effort to get improve the project's quality. Would strive hard to achieve success. 
<br/>

Fixed all my previous bugs and have fetched data from NYtimes API for Bestsellers and Google Books API 
for Book and author searches.
