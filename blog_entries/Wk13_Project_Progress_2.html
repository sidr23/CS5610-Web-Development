<h3>Bugs and Updations</h3>

<p>
Made all my pages fluid responsive finally!<br/>
Sat through the last two days understanding and revising the fluid responsive experiments of Prof Rasala especially the Gettysburg and the Alice in Wonderland Experiments<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to it all pages of the project and homepage are now completely fluid responsive. When tested on my cell phone found a bug in the project bestsellers page in the description column. Fixed it!<br/>
