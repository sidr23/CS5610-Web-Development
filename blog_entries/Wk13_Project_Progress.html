<h3>Project</h3>

<p>
Have changed the UI of the project after 3 weeks because the previous UI was not fluid responsive.<br/>
Was forced to simplify the CSS associated with the homepage because the Menu bar containing links wasn't
working properly in Mobile Phones and Tablets. Still trying to fix the code, but I am not too positive about it because of the hard coding
in the form of absolute positioning with percentage values.<br/>
<br/>
Modifying my documentation accordingly to make it viable to the new layout which now has a Book News Page that was previously 
present in the Homepage itself in a div box.
