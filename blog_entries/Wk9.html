<h3>Week 9</h3>

<p>
Work on databases<br/>
</p>

<p>
After establishing a connection of the database, experimented on database commands like select,insert,delete by creating a database called as test.<br/>

The experiments I tried this week were<br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_8/W08E01.aspx" target="_blank">Databse population and display</a><br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_8/W08E02.aspx" target="_blank">Insert into database</a><br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_8/W08E03.aspx" target="_blank">Delete content off database</a><br>

Currenty developing the project home page. Once, the project topic is approved it'll be functional with certain features.<br/>
