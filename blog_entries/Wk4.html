Fourth Week's Analysis
</p>

<p>
This week tried Ajax and Jquery topics 
</p>

<p>
An update on the last week's exp that I forgot to mention in the blog: <br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_3/W03E05.html" target="_blank">Sortable Objects</a><br>
The experiments I tried this week were
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_4/W04E01.html" target="_blank">Magnify image using JQuery</a><br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_4/W04E02.html" target="_blank">Embedding Web Api using Ajax</a><br>
<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/sidr/experiments/Exp_4/W04E03.html" target="_blank">Auto complete feature</a><br>

With respect to the experiments, AJAX requires Asp.net basics so I'm learning those concepts. This is the main reason why I couldn't implement more experiments although the ones I've done are using Ajax and JQuery without ASP.NET.
Would like to do more experiments once Professor teaches more about Asp and how to use it. Due to the lone lecture this week only auto complete feature was taken up in detail. I've tried implementing that feature in my third exp.
And for the project topic,based on the conversation I had with Prof Rasala, I did speculate on various topics. But the main issue would be in fetching data and as that hasn't yet been covered in class, It'b be wiser to wait for a couple of weeks before finalizing on a topic. 
There is a bug with the magnification experiment I'm trying to fix. It started troubling me esp when I moved the js and css files to the parent folder. It was working absolutely fine till I moved those files to the required destination and changed the path.
